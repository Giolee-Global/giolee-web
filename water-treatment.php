                        <p class="mb-20">Giolee manage and treat different waste water like effluent and produced water.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Produced water is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds and the largest volume of byproduct generated during oil and gas recovery operations. The potential of oilfield produced water can be a source of fresh water for water-stressed oil-producing countries and the increasing environmental concerns in addition to stringent legislation’s on produced water discharge into the environment have made produced water management a significant part of the oil and gas business.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Produced water quality varies based on geographic locations, type of hydrocarbon produced, and the geochemistry of the producing formation.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Giolee performs assessment of water quality characteristics of produced water in terms of geographic location &amp; water quality criteria. The samples of the produced water will be tested and analyzed in our accredited laboratory.</p>

                        <p class="mb-20">The management of produced water presents many challenges and can pose significant costs to operators. Current techniques for produced water management include several methods such as underground injection either for increasing recovery or disposal, produced water treatment and discharge, evaporation, reuse and beneficial use.</p>
                        <p class="mb-20">Especially for water-parched areas, the large quantities of water consumed during hydraulic fracturing could make shale gas production economically unsustainable as injected water during hydraulic fracturing containing lots of chemicals would contaminate the underground water. The large volumes of flow back water and produced water which are released with shale gas production can pollute the groundwater and surface water if not treated properly.</p>

                        <h4 class="mb-20">Produced Water Treatment</h4>
                        <p class="mb-20">Produced water always contains high concentrations of TDS, metal ions as well as oil and grease. To ensure the injected produced water is confined in the injection zone in a manner that does not contaminate the water bearing geologic formation, produced water needs to be treated before injection. Therefore, to meet the UIC and RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) regulations, removal of TDS, TOC, oil/grease, hardness, and metal ions (including ammonia and boron) are the main treatment goals.</p>

                        <h5>Biosparging</h5>
                        <p class="mb-20">Giolee treats and remediates soil and groundwater water using its technology called Biosparging for which it has Patent Right. Biosparging consists of the injection of pressurized air(oxygen) into a contaminated zone or acquirer to stimulate in-Siri aerobic biological activities. This technique applies to dissolved and residual contamination in the saturated zone and target’s biodegradable contaminants under aerobic conditions.</p>
